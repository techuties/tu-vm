# Suggestions Hub

This folder contains detailed, implementation-oriented suggestions for building a community-driven website and contributor system without reinventing existing work.

## Historical baseline used

These suggestions are consolidated from previous `community-suggestions-*` branches so repeated ideas are reused instead of reauthored from scratch.

Recurring themes identified across historical branches:

1. Website information architecture for docs + operations + community
2. Community governance and contribution workflow
3. Practical contributor tooling for day-to-day operations
4. A phased roadmap built from already proposed feature directions

## Files in this folder

- `website-historical-baseline.md`

- `website-information-architecture.md`

## Design principles for all suggestions

1. Reuse existing project surfaces first (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `tu-vm.sh`, helper API, nginx landing page).
2. Add modular improvements over deep rewrites.
3. Keep secure defaults and LAN-first behavior as non-negotiable.
4. Prioritize contribution quality, reproducibility, and maintainability.
