# Suggestions Hub

This folder contains detailed, implementation-oriented suggestions for building a community-driven website and contributor system without reinventing existing work.

## Historical baseline used

These suggestions are consolidated from previous `community-suggestions-*` branches so repeated ideas are reused instead of reauthored from scratch.

Recurring themes identified across historical branches:

1. Website information architecture for docs + operations + community
2. Community governance and contribution workflow
3. Practical contributor tooling for day-to-day operations
4. A phased roadmap built from already proposed feature directions

## Files in this folder

- **Start here:** [`index.md`](./index.md)
  Canonical community suggestion map, current status, and the recommended execution path.

- `website-historical-baseline.md`  
  Historical suggestion patterns and how they were merged into a single framework.

- `website-information-architecture.md`  
  Detailed website structure, content model, and docs framework recommendation.

- `website-community-framework.md`  
  Community operating model, governance, ownership, and review standards.

- `website-contributor-tooling.md`  
  Concrete tooling proposals that improve day-to-day contributor productivity.

- `website-roadmap-from-historical-suggestions.md`  
  Sequenced roadmap that maps historical suggestions to implementation milestones.

## How to use historical suggestions

Before adding a new proposal, compare it with the canonical files above and the older historical notes in this folder. Treat a repeated idea as one of three outcomes:

1. **Already implemented**: link to the shipped file, command, workflow, or dashboard surface instead of reopening the idea.
2. **Partial overlap**: extend the closest existing suggestion with a narrower follow-up, acceptance criteria, and validation notes.
3. **Net new**: add a proposal only after documenting what existing framework, tool, or workflow was evaluated first.

This keeps the community system focused on reusable improvements instead of parallel suggestion threads.

## Design principles for all suggestions

1. Reuse existing project surfaces first (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `tu-vm.sh`, helper API, nginx landing page).
2. Add modular improvements over deep rewrites.
3. Keep secure defaults and LAN-first behavior as non-negotiable.
4. Prioritize contribution quality, reproducibility, and maintainability.

To submit an idea via GitHub only, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) at the repository root (Issues + PR templates).

For the **trimmed backlog** (implemented items removed) and **ten prioritized next recommendations**, see [`implementation-backlog.md`](./implementation-backlog.md).
