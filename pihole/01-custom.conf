# Pi-hole Custom DNS Configuration
# Allow external DNS queries from any source

# Disable local-service restriction to allow external queries

# Use Docker's internal DNS resolver for all queries
# This allows internal hostname resolution while still using Pi-hole's blocking
server=127.0.0.11

# Use Cloudflare DNS for external queries (privacy-focused, independent)
server=1.1.1.1
server=1.0.0.1

# Custom DNS entries for services
# Note: These will be resolved via Nginx reverse proxy
# The actual IP is auto-detected from HOST_IP in .env
# If you need custom DNS entries, uncomment and set your VM IP:
# address=/minio.tu.local/YOUR_VM_IP
# address=/api.minio.tu.local/YOUR_VM_IP
